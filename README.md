# buttons.scss
A ready made library of button in css and scss. This is just a little library of pre-styled buttons that I made. 

It is very simple to use. The simplest use is:
```
<button class="btn">Button</button>
```
This will render the default button. 

---

The button classes can be chained to create unique buttons like this:
```
<button class="btn hg alert grows">Button</button>
```

---
# The Classes

`-btn`

## Add one of these classes to your button

-info
-alert
-warning
-success
-lined
-rounded
-lg
-hg
-grows
-shrinks

```
